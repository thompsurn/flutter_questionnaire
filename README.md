## My first Flutter project.


# Flutter Questionnaire is an interactive app developed in Android Studio to demonstrate skills learned through Codecademyâ€™s Intro to Flutter course. Built with Dart and Flutter, the app presents a series of questions, tracks user responses, and provides a clean, engaging UI experience. This project highlights proficiency in mobile app development fundamentals, from widget design and state management to user interaction.
