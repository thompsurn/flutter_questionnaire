## My first Flutter project.


Flutter Questionnaire is a foundational survey app built in Android Studio to showcase essential Flutter and Dart skills acquired through Codecademyâ€™s Intro to Flutter course. This project demonstrates proficiency with core Flutter widgets, including layout elements like Container, Column, and Row, to create a clean and structured UI. Though not yet interactive, it serves as a base for future enhancements, such as handling user input.
